'The Time Machine' is a classic work of science-fiction by H.G. Wells. The story commences with a British dinner feast where a faction of gentlemen chat about a Time Machine which is being designed by one of them. It is peculiar to note that the characters at this party are not named. The person, who is designing the time machine, is addressed to as the Time Traveller. When the group meets up again the next week, the Time Traveller is nowhere to be seen. Upon his late entrance, he narrates about his interesting stopover into the future.

A huge portion of this narrative details about the stay of Time Traveller in a strange world where there are shady forces creeping behind a heavenly cover. Time Traveller is able to flee away from a wood-blaze and some aggressive creatures and roam about in other time eras prior to coming back to his friends in the party. Despite his adventurous escapade, none of his friends are ready to believe him. After a few days one of the dinner guests goes to the time Traveller's house to check on him. He is the last person to see the designer before the time Traveller vanishes away with his time machine. The tale is beautifully narrated and takes the reader into the fiction world of technology. A worthy grab for the sci-fi lovers, this book can be ordered online at Amazon India.
