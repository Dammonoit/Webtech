<pre> -by<h3>Peter Theil, Blake Masters</h3></font>
</pre>
<p>
The book Zero To One is about nurturing the next big idea to build a valuable global company. If you are only following in the steps known entrepreneurs, then the authors believe that you are headed nowhere.

The book recalls how certain innovative ideas were incubated and how people behind them dared to dream big and even did realize some of them. But trying to replicate or improvise what Bill Gates achieved with developing an operating system or what Large Page got out of making a user friendly search engine is not going to help in realizing the dream for building the next global business empire.

This book also compiles the startups culture as discussed by Peter Thiel in his lecture for Stanford University students in 2012 with details about various other aspects of entrepreneurship.

The authors encourage to think out of the box, without delving too much into the lives of the great entrepreneurs for there are already many books on that. Thiel, himself a successful serial entrepreneur, instead motivates for chalking out ones own course, breaking conventions, changing the rules and about disruptive technologies that revolutionize the way business is conducted.

The book was well received and did get recommendations from notable authors and business enthusiasts. Written in a easy to understand language, the book attempts to describe the demands and stakes that drive the startup world.
